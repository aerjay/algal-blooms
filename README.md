![variable analysis]("Variable analysis of algae blooms")

Many key variables in algae growth can be either directly measured from remote sensing satellites (blue) or estimated from spectral image data (orange). However, some must still be

- [ ] Training a random forest model for correlating hyperspectral images to key growth variables such as nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, surface temperature, and surface irradiance.
> MacDougall et al. (2018) has shown that LAI, EVI, GEMI, and GVI indices may be correlated to nitrogen content with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.7
